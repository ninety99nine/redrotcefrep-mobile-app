     *  The identifier is used to make sure that we can never have duplicate events on the same subscribed channel e.g
     *  Suppose that we subscribe to an channel such as subscribe('private-example.1', onEventLogicOne). The event
     *  called "onEventLogicOne" will be saved on the _subscribedChannelEvents so that it can be later called
     *  whenever updates are received. The problem is that we might leave the widget and then come back
     *  to the same widget without unsubscribing from the channel to clear the "onEventLogicOne" event.
     *  This can become a problem since we would re-run this subscribe() method, and although we won't 
     *  be running the (await getInstance()).subscribe() method below, we would still add this event 
     *  to the _subscribedChannelEvents creating duplicate entries of the exact same event logic. 
     *  To allow us to utilise this subscribe() method without the conflict of ending up with 
     *  duplicate events of the same logic, we can use identifiers.
     * 
     *  _subscribedChannelEvents: {
     *    'private-example.1': {          <--- The "1" would represent the user's ID
     *      'identifier2': () { ... },    <--- You can specify a name for your other events so that we never saved it twice
     *      'identifier2': () { ... },    <--- You can specify a name for your other events so that we never saved it twice
     *      ...
     *    },
     *    private-example2.1: {
     *      ....
     *    }
     *    ...
     *  }
     * 
     *  Here is an simple use case. Suppose you have 2 widgets in 2 separate files that need to all listen to the
     *  private notifications channel on "private-notification.1". On each of these files you can subscribe and
     *  pass the identifier and onEvent callback. Since this is a Provider, the events set on the
     *  _subscribedChannelEvents will be saved even if the user can navigate elsewhere. However
     *  by navigating elsewhere and returning back and calling the subscribe() method, we can
     *  make sure that by using an identifier, we can know which events have already been set
     *  and which have not. This way we can always avoid duplicate event entries for any
     *  channel that we have subscribed to.
     * 
     *  In widget 1: subscribe(channelName: 'private-notification.1', identifier: 'notifications-page', onEvent: () { ... }})
     *  In widget 2: subscribe(channelName: 'private-notification.1', identifier: 'home-page', onEvent: () { ... }})
     * 
     *  This custom code was implemented because Pusher does not allow an authenticated user to subscribe
     *  more that once to the same channel name. We had to rewrite the "subscribe" and "unsubscribe" to
     *  extend this limitation and allow us to be able to subcribe to the same channel but also call
     *  the different events necessary to be called in different widgets.
