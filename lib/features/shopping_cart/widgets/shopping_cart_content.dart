     *  If the Shoppable Store Model does not have any selected products, but the current state of the 
     *  lastSelectedProductItems is not empty, then we must reset its value by also making it empty. 
     *  Lets assume that the app loads the first time and this ShoppingCartContent widget is rendered. In 
     *  this state the hasSelectedProducts = false and lastSelectedProductItems is empty. When we 
     *  select any product then the hasSelectedProducts = true and the Shoppable Store Model 
     *  selectedProducts property (which has the selected product) will differ from the 
     *  lastSelectedProductItems property (which has no selected product), therefore
     *  allowing the _requestInspectShoppingCart() to make a call to update the
     *  Shoppable Store Model shoppingCart and the current state of the 
     *  lastSelectedProductItems to match the state of the 
     *  selectedProducts. 
     * 
     *  If the same product is removed, the selected products are emptied and the Shoppable Store 
     *  Model shoppingCart is removed and the notify listeners will be called leading to this 
     *  didChangeDependencies() method to be called with the emptied selected products. The 
     *  lastSelectedProductItems still holds the old state, but the _requestInspectShoppingCart() 
     *  method will not run since hasSelectedProducts = false. The problem is that if i now 
     *  select the same product again, the state of the  Shoppable Store Model selectedProducts 
     *  will be changed, but it will be the same as the old state of lastSelectedProductItems 
     *  and the _requestInspectShoppingCart() method will not be called beause 
     *  _productsHaveChanged() = false eventhough hasSelectedProducts = true. 
     *  
     *  This means we can't update the shopping cart which was recently removed. To combat this issue, 
     *  we must reset the lastSelectedProductItems everytime that the Shoppable Store Model 
     *  selectedProducts is emptied. As a result, when the Shoppable Store Model 
     *  selectedProducts are populated, the outcome is  different from that of 
     *  the lastSelectedProductItems and the _requestInspectShoppingCart()
     *  method will now be called since _productsHaveChanged() = true and
     *  hasSelectedProducts = true.

    /**
     *  When selecting a product, changing quantity, e.t.c, the Shoppable
     *  Store Model will be updated, which will then notify listeners, 
     *  and since we are listening for changes on this Store Model
     *  because of the property set on the build() method:
     * 
     *  Provider.of<ShoppableStore>(context, listen: true);
     * 
     *  This build() method will therefore be triggered to rebuild, thereby 
     *  causing the didChangeDependencies() to run as well. Once this
     *  happens we can execute the following updates:
     * 
     *  1) _requestInspectShoppingCart(): We can request the shopping cart
     * 
     *  Resolving Infinite Loop Scenerio
     *  --------------------------------
     * 
     *  When making the first Request to retrieve the shopping cart, the Request will complete
     *  and execute the setShoppingCart() of the ShoppableStore model. This will update the
     *  shopping cart on the ShoppableStore model and notify listeners. As a result the 
     *  build() method will be called again as well as the didChangeDependencies(). 
     *  This will cause the _requestInspectShoppingCart() to run again, and the 
     *  cycle repeats itself over and over again without end (infinite loop)
     * 
     *  To prevent this infinite loop, we must always check if any changes have been
     *  made on the selected products before we can make our request. If no changes
     *  have been made then the request must not be attempted.
     * 
     *  About hasInitialized
     *  --------------------
     * 
     *  The "hasInitialized" simply prevents us from running _requestInspectShoppingCart()
     *  while the Widget is being initialised. This would trigger an automatic execution
     *  of _requestInspectShoppingCart() e.g When we navigate from the StoreCard to
     *  the StorePage, the Store Page will start to setup this ShoppingCartContent widget,
     *  thereby calling didChangeDependencies() before the build() method is
     *  called and therefore automatically make a request to update the
     *  shopping cart. Remove "hasInitialized" if this is desired.
     * 
     *  We don't really worry about the _requestInspectShoppingCart() being automatically 
     *  executed in the case of the ShoppingCartContent() being a descendant of a StoreCard() 
     *  because the StoreCard() normally starts without a shoppingCart or selected 
     *  products. So since this ShoppingCartContent() widget's lastSelectedProductItems 
     *  are empty and the Shoppable Store selectedProducts are empty, we 
     *  therefore don't have  a difference in items that could cause the 
     *  _requestInspectShoppingCart() to be executed. As a result this
     *  only becomes a cause for concern when ShoppingCartContent() is
     *  being built while we already have selectedProducts on the
     *  Shoppable Store Model.
     * 
     *  In the case of the ShoppingCartContent() being a descendant of a StorePage(), we 
     *  normally navigate to the StorePage() with or without the shoppingCart or 
     *  selected products. So depending on the case, this auto-execution of the
     *  _requestInspectShoppingCart() might not be desired. In our case, the
     *  justification is to minimize the number of Api Requests being made.
